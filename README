/*
 * SHORT DESCRIPTION
 */

libs is generic data structures library, written in C as small replacement to bloated STL.
It covers following data structures:
-- _htbl.c, _htbl.h -- hash table;
-- _listb.c, _listb.h -- double-linked list;
-- _list.c, _list.h -- single-linked list;
-- _queue.c, _queue.h -- queue;
-- _stack.c, _stack.h -- stack (don't be confused with system programming terminology);
-- _tree.c, _tree.h -- binary tree.
It also includes implementation of parts of libc's string.h & stdlib.h:
-- _stddef.h -- common types;
-- _stdlib.c, _stdlib.h -- search & sort;
-- _string.c, _string.h -- memory & string operations.

For using libs you need to implement your own compare, allocation & deallocation functions depending on nature of particular types you are working with.
